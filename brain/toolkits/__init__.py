"""
Toolkits package (LAP: skeletons only).

Toolkits are reasoning substrates only:
- No execution
- No filesystem or network I/O
- No memory or identity learning

Toolkits MAY:
- Define manifests, contracts, and playbooks
- Produce structured proposals and verification plans (data only)
- Specify which callable tools would be used later (as request specs), without executing them
