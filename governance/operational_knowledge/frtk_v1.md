# FRTK v1 — Finance Reasoning Toolkit

**Status:** LAP Skeleton (Inert)

FRTK is the complete specialist finance toolkit expressed as:
- A manifest of finance tools/capabilities (inventory + contracts)
- Playbooks for phased ingestion, normalization, correction, and audit
- Adapters that emit request specs for future finance actions

## Hard Boundaries (LOCKED during LAP)
- Finance execution is BLOCKED
- No execution, no filesystem or network I/O
- No memory or identity learning

## Relationship to Finance Systems
- Firefly III remains the system of record
- All writes require explicit unblocking and governance
